# Application to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI)

Simple shiny application to calculate body mass index, the link to the shinyapps.io server where the application is deployed is <https://edanamerchan.shinyapps.io/DataProd/>.

The application is very simple there is a checkbox to select the units you want to use. The default is in English system with the weight is in pounds and the height in inches. If you check the box this will change the unit system to SI the international units systems or metric system, where the weight is in kilograms and the height in meters.  

The BMI result categorize the person as:
- underweight (BMI less than 18.5)
- normal weight (BMI between 18.5 & 24.9)
- overweight (BMI between 25.0 & 29.9)
- obese (BMI 30.0 and above)
